            <h2>Lore and Worldbuilding</h2>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>The History of Eyloria</h3>
                <h4>The Age of Harmony (0-1000)</h4>
                <p>In the beginning, Eyloria was a realm of balance. Three gods held dominion: Ksavir, the god of forsaken souls, who offered refuge to the lost and broken; Elyria, goddess of purity, whose light cleansed the land; and Torval, god of order, who structured society with laws and faith. Mortals revered all three, building temples where the forsaken could find solace, the pure could shine, and the orderly could thrive. This was the Age of Harmony, a time of peace where Eyloria’s forests bloomed, its rivers ran clear, and its people lived without fear.</p>

                <h4>The Betrayal (Year 1001)</h4>
                <p>Harmony crumbled when Elyria and Torval grew jealous of Ksavir’s growing following. The forsaken—outcasts, sinners, and the broken—flocked to him, their numbers swelling. Fearing his power, Elyria and Torval conspired to betray him. They lured Ksavir to the southwestern edge of Eyloria, where they entombed his divine form in the Misty Forest, sealing him in eternal mist with a ritual powered by the nascent Mirror of Worlds. Ksavir’s screams echoed across the land, his blood seeping into the earth, birthing the Swamps of Despair. The Age of Shadows began.</p>

                <h4>The Age of Shadows (1001-Present)</h4>
                <p>With Ksavir gone, Elyria and Torval declared the Light supreme. They established the Light’s Faithful, a zealous order that hunted heretics and enforced their doctrine. Temples to Ksavir were razed, his followers branded as forsaken and driven underground. The land itself suffered—Morana’s dark magic corrupted the Cursed Forest, Zarkan’s chaos bled into the Mountains of Madness, and the Mirror of Worlds, now in Mortimer II’s hands, warped reality from Avalon. The Outcasts of Ksavir, a scattered resistance, whisper of his return, while the Light rules with an iron fist, their golden cities hiding a rotting core.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>The Mirror of Worlds</h3>
                <p>The Mirror of Worlds is a divine artifact forged during Ksavir’s betrayal. Elyria and Torval imbued it with reality-warping power, using shards of celestial glass to bind Ksavir’s essence. Over centuries, the Mirror was shattered, its shards scattered across Eyloria—some held by mad guardians like Zarath, others buried in rifts like the Valley of Illusions. Mortimer II, ruler of Avalon, reassembled most of the shards, using the Mirror to bend reality: he can alter time, summon otherworldly beings, and create illusions that deceive even the gods. But the Mirror’s power is unstable, bleeding chaos into the world, creating rifts and corrupting all who wield it.</p>
                <p>The Antiheroes’ ultimate goal is to destroy the Mirror, but doing so risks unleashing the chaotic energies it contains. The ritual to destroy it (Arcana DC 22) requires all shards to be gathered and a sacrifice of divine essence—potentially Ksavir himself, should he be awakened.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Geography of Eyloria</h3>
                <p>Eyloria is a land of stark contrasts, its beauty marred by corruption and oppression. It spans from the desolate southwest to the gleaming northeast, each region shaped by the gods’ conflict.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Southwest (Misty Forest, Alder Hamlet):</strong> A forsaken region where Ksavir’s influence lingers. The Misty Forest is shrouded in eternal mist, hiding his tomb, while Alder Hamlet sits on the graves of his army, its people under Torval’s watchful eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>Central-West (Cursed Forest, Swamps of Despair):</strong> Lands scarred by divine sorrow and dark magic. The Cursed Forest, corrupted by Morana, is a twisted woodland, while the Swamps of Despair, born of Elyria’s tears and Ksavir’s blood, drown all hope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Central-East (Lightfort):</strong> Elyria’s bastion, a fortress of light that hides zealous corruption. Its golden walls and radiant statues mask a fanatical populace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Northeast (Valley of Illusions, Mountains of Madness, Creststone City, Avalon):</strong> The heart of the Light’s power, but also the epicenter of the Mirror’s chaos. The Valley of Illusions bleeds reality-warping magic, the Mountains of Madness hum with Zarkan’s chaos, Creststone City is Torval’s stronghold, and Avalon, the capital, is Mortimer II’s seat of power.</li>
                </ul>

                    <td>Thick mist (visibility 20 ft), whispers (disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, DC 14 Wisdom save to resist), cold air (Constitution DC 12 or 1 level of exhaustion after 4 hours).</td>
                    <td>Ksavir’s tomb, a stone sarcophagus etched with runes, emanating a faint necrotic aura; hidden shrines to Ksavir, offering minor boons if found (Religion DC 15).</td>
                    <td>Use eerie sound effects—whispers, distant wails, rustling leaves. The forest feels alive and hostile. Disturbing Ksavir’s tomb triggers Mist Wraith attacks. Ysmera appears here to guide the PCs.</td>

                    <td>Emphasize the unnatural—bleeding trees, warped animals, whispers of Morana’s name. The forest disorients PCs, making navigation a challenge. Baba Yaga’s presence should feel ominous and unpredictable.</td>

                    <td>Kaelith’s lair, a sunken shrine to Elyria now defiled by Ksavir’s blood; glowing will-o’-wisps that lead PCs astray (Survival DC 15 to resist).</td>

                    <td>The Hall of Purity, where Sister Lirien holds court, adorned with glowing crystals; a hidden armory with radiant weapons (Investigation DC 18 to find, guarded by Zealot Constructs).</td>
                    <td>Highlight the contrast between beauty and oppression—gleaming walls, but screams echo from the dungeons. Lirien interrogates PCs; failure (Persuasion DC 18) leads to combat. Use Zealot Constructs to make infiltration tense.</td>

                    <td>Thryme’s camp, a tent filled with mirrored surfaces that reflect distorted futures; a rift to the Mirror’s realm, leaking raw magic (Arcana DC 20 to harness, grants a 3rd-level spell slot but 1 Corruption Point).</td>
                    <td>Use surreal descriptions—trees melting, mirrored PCs, voices of their past. Thryme’s reversed speech adds confusion. Phantoms exploit illusions, making combat disorienting.</td>

                    <td>Zarkan’s tomb, a cavern pulsing with chaotic runes (Arcana DC 18 to decipher, reveals Mirror shard location); Zarath’s lair, filled with warped mirrors that reflect PCs’ fears (Wisdom DC 16 or frightened).</td>
                    <td>Use chaotic effects—sudden storms, gravity shifts, whispers of Zarkan’s name. Zarath guards a Mirror shard, which PCs need. The environment should feel hostile and unpredictable, testing the PCs’ sanity.</td>

                    <td>The Temple of Torval, where Veyra performs her rituals, surrounded by necrotic runes; a black market in the slums, selling forbidden relics (Persuasion DC 16 to access, guarded by Necrotic Guardians).</td>
                    <td>Emphasize oppression—public executions, chanting crowds, the stench of burning flesh. Veyra’s ritual in the square is a focal point; interrupting it angers her. Necrotic Guardians patrol relentlessly.</td>

                    <td>Reality shifts (Investigation DC 20 to notice), random magical effects (DMG Wild Magic table, 1/hour), mirrored surfaces (Wisdom DC 18 or 2d6 psychic damage from seeing distorted futures).</td>
                    <td>The Mirror Chamber, a crystalline dome in the central palace where Mortimer II resides; the Hall of Reflections, a gauntlet of Mirror Sentinels leading to the Chamber.</td>
                    <td>Use epic descriptions—towering spires, air crackling with energy, reality bending (e.g., NPCs looping conversations). Mortimer II resides in the Mirror Chamber, guarded by Sentinels. Destroying the Mirror is the campaign’s climax.</td>

                    <td>Her voice should echo, as if from a void. Use poetic language for her prophecies (e.g., “The forsaken weeps where light blinds”). She’s loyal to Ksavir, not the PCs—her guidance is genuine but vague.</td>
                    <td>Ysmera appears when PCs enter the Misty Forest, offering a prophecy about their journey. She’ll guide them but flee if attacked. Use her to set the campaign’s tone—hopeful yet tragic.</td>

                    <td>His sermons are fiery—quote Torval’s scriptures (e.g., “The Light purges all shadows!”). He interrogates PCs with piercing eyes, quick to judge. Show his paranoia through nervous ticks (e.g., clutching his holy symbol).</td>
                    <td>Gideon confronts PCs in the village square, demanding proof of their faith (Insight DC 16 to detect lies). If they fail (Persuasion DC 16), he attacks, summoning villagers as fodder (AC 10, HP 5). Use him to create early tension.</td>

                    <td>Her blindness makes her other senses sharp—describe her tilting her head to “hear” darkness. She quotes Elyria (e.g., “Purity burns the wicked”). She’s unyielding—diplomacy is hard but possible.</td>
                    <td>Lirien interrogates PCs in the Hall of Purity (Persuasion DC 18 to avoid combat). She fights with zeal, using Divine Smite on “heretics.” If defeated, she offers a radiant amulet as a plea for mercy. Use her to show the Light’s corruption.</td>

                    <td>His madness should be vivid—laugh hysterically, then scream in terror. He casts spells erratically, often triggering Wild Magic (e.g., turning into a sheep mid-fight). He’s desperate to protect the shard.</td>

                    <td>Mortimer II is the final boss, residing in the Mirror Chamber. He’s guarded by Mirror Sentinels (2d4). Destroying the Mirror requires a ritual (Arcana DC 22)—he’ll fight to the death to protect it. Use him for an epic finale.</td>

            <h2>Gameplay Rules</h2>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Character Creation</h3>
                <h4>Basics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Level:</strong> Start at Level 5. The campaign is designed for 4-6 players, progressing to Level 10 by the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Use any standard D&D 5e class, reflavored to fit the dark fantasy theme (e.g., a cleric might worship Ksavir, a paladin might be a heretic hunter).</li>
                    <li><strong>Races:</strong> Any D&D 5e race, but reflavor to fit Eyloria (e.g., elves as ancient forest dwellers, tieflings as descendants of Ksavir’s followers).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Use standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or point buy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backgrounds:</strong> Choose or create a background tying you to Eyloria’s conflict (e.g., a former Light zealot, a survivor of the Swamps of Despair).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Special Trait: Mark of the Forsaken</h4>
                <p>All PCs bear the Mark of the Forsaken, a faint scar-like rune on their skin, tying them to Ksavir’s cause. It grants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> On saving throws against fear effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> On Charisma (Persuasion) checks with the Light’s Faithful, who sense the mark’s heresy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Connection:</strong> Once per long rest, a PC can commune with Ksavir’s essence (Religion DC 15), gaining a cryptic vision (GM discretion).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Core Mechanics (Based on D&D 5e)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combat:</strong> Follow D&D 5e rules (attack rolls, AC, HP, saving throws, etc.). Use a grid or theater of the mind, as preferred.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill Checks:</strong> Use D&D 5e skills (e.g., Perception, Stealth, Arcana). DCs are provided for challenges (e.g., DC 15 Wisdom save to resist Possession).</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting:</strong> Short rests take 1 hour, long rests take 8 hours. In dangerous areas (e.g., Cursed Forest, Mountains of Madness), long rests have a 50% chance of being interrupted by monsters (roll a d20: 1-10, encounter occurs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Death Saves:</strong> Standard D&D 5e rules (3 successes to stabilize, 3 failures to die). If a PC dies, they can be revived by Ksavir’s essence (Religion DC 20, costs 1 Forsaken Point from each party member).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Special Rules</h3>
                <h4>Forsaken Points (FP)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>PCs start with 3 FP, representing Ksavir’s favor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spend 1 FP:</strong> Reroll a failed saving throw, skill check, or attack roll, or gain advantage on an attack roll.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refresh:</strong> FP refresh after a long rest, or by performing a ritual to honor Ksavir (Religion DC 15, 1 hour).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Corruption</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exposure to the Mirror’s power (e.g., Valley of Illusions, Mountains of Madness) risks corruption.</li>
                    <li>Failing a Wisdom save against chaotic effects (e.g., DC 16 in the Mountains) grants 1 Corruption Point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effects:</strong> At 3 points, suffer disadvantage on Wisdom saves. At 5 points, suffer permanent madness (DMG madness table).</li>
                    <li><strong>Removing Corruption:</strong> A ritual to Ksavir (Religion DC 18, 500 gp in materials) removes 1 point, or destroying a Mirror shard removes 1 point from all PCs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Mirror Shards</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collecting a shard (e.g., from Zarath) grants a boon and a curse (GM discretion).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example Boon:</strong> +1 to a stat for the party (e.g., +1 Intelligence after the Valley of Illusions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example Curse:</strong> Disadvantage on Wisdom saves for 1 week, as the shard’s chaos lingers.</li>
                    <li>All shards must be gathered to destroy the Mirror in Avalon (Arcana DC 22 ritual, requires a sacrifice of divine essence—e.g., Ksavir’s blood or a PC’s life force).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Advancement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Milestones:</strong> Level up after completing major objectives (e.g., surviving Misty Forest, defeating Sister Lirien, claiming a Mirror shard). Suggested progression: Level 6 after Cursed Forest, Level 7 after Lightfort, Level 8 after Mountains of Madness, Level 9 after Creststone City, Level 10 before Avalon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treasure:</strong> Find magic items in key locations (e.g., +1 dagger in Baba Yaga’s hut, Cloak of Resistance in Creststone City, chaotic staff in Mountains of Madness).</li>
                    <li><strong>Experience (Optional):</strong> If using XP, award 500 XP per minor encounter (e.g., 2 Mist Wraiths), 1,000 XP per major encounter (e.g., Kaelith), and 2,000 XP per boss (e.g., Zarath).</li>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Running the Campaign</h3>
                <h4>Tone and Atmosphere</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a dark, oppressive tone. Describe the decay of the land (e.g., “The trees weep black sap, their branches clawing at the sky”), the zealotry of the Light (e.g., “A child chants Torval’s name, her eyes hollow”), and the Mirror’s warping effects (e.g., “The air shimmers, your reflection showing a twisted future”).</li>
                    <li>Use sensory details—sounds (whispers in the Misty Forest, chants in Creststone City), smells (decay in the Swamps, incense in Lightfort), and visuals (shimmering illusions in the Valley, chaotic storms in the Mountains).</li>
                    <li>Make the world feel alive and hostile—NPCs are paranoid, the environment fights back, and the Mirror’s influence grows stronger as PCs approach Avalon.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pacing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each location should take 1-2 sessions (3-4 hours each). Allow time for exploration, roleplay, and combat, but keep the pace tight to maintain tension.</li>
                    <li>Use travel between locations for minor encounters (e.g., a lone Grave Shadow, a sudden storm in the Mountains of Madness) or environmental challenges (e.g., crossing a river, navigating a blizzard).</li>
                    <li>Build toward the finale in Avalon—escalate the stakes with each location. The Mirror’s effects should become more pronounced (e.g., illusions in the Valley, reality shifts in Avalon).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Player Choices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Allow PCs to negotiate with NPCs like Baba Yaga or Sister Lirien, but ensure consequences (e.g., Baba Yaga’s curses, Lirien’s tests of faith). Use skill checks (e.g., Persuasion DC 16 to sway Gideon) to resolve non-combat solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Reward creative stealth in places like Lightfort and Creststone City (e.g., disguising as zealots, Stealth DC 20). Failure should lead to combat or capture (e.g., thrown into Lightfort’s dungeons, requiring a rescue).</li>
                    <li><strong>Combat:</strong> Encourage tactical play—e.g., disbelieving Illusionary Phantoms (Investigation DC 16), using radiant damage against Grave Shadows. Punish recklessness with overwhelming odds (e.g., Zealot Constructs’ explosions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Moral Dilemmas:</strong> Present tough choices—e.g., ally with Baba Yaga for power (at a cost), spare Sister Lirien (risking her return), or destroy the Mirror (potentially destabilizing Eyloria).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Foreshadowing</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drop hints about the Mirror early—Ysmera’s prophecies in the Misty Forest (e.g., “A mirror shatters the world”), Thryme’s visions in the Valley (e.g., “The glass king rules where light bends”).</li>
                    <li>Foreshadow Mortimer II’s power—NPCs in Creststone City whisper of “the king who shapes reality,” and reality shifts become more frequent as PCs near Avalon.</li>
                    <li>Hint at Ksavir’s potential awakening—his blood in the Swamps grants visions (e.g., “A shadowed god rises”), and relics in the Misty Forest pulse with his essence.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Ysmera:</strong> Her ethereal nature should unsettle—describe her form flickering, her voice echoing. She’s a tragic figure, desperate to awaken Ksavir but fearful of failure. Use her to guide PCs but also to show the cost of Ksavir’s fall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Father Gideon:</strong> His zealotry should be palpable—his sermons are fiery, his gaze piercing. He’s a man broken by loss, seeing heresy everywhere. Use him to create early conflict, showing the Light’s oppression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baba Yaga:</strong> She’s a wildcard—cackle mid-sentence, offer deals with a sly grin. Her cruelty should be evident, but her knowledge makes her valuable. Use her to test PC morality and greed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kaelith:</strong> Her sorrow and wrath should chill—describe her wail as a wave of cold air, her form ashen and pale. She’s a tragic villain, her vengeance misguided. Use her to show the swamp’s despair.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sister Lirien:</strong> Her faith is her strength and weakness—quote Elyria with conviction, but show cracks in her resolve (e.g., “The Light… must prevail…”). She’s a zealot but human. Use her to show the Light’s corruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thryme:</strong> His madness should confuse—reversed speech, erratic movements. He’s a victim of the Mirror, his visions valuable but jumbled. Use him to foreshadow the Mirror’s power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zarath:</strong> His insanity should be vivid—laugh, scream, mutter to the shard. He’s a tragic figure, consumed by chaos. Use him to show the Mirror’s corrupting influence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Veyra:</strong> Her charisma should unnerve—her songs are haunting, her gaze cold. She’s a conflicted villain, serving Torval but craving power. Use her to show the Light’s hypocrisy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mortimer II:</strong> His arrogance
