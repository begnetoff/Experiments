            <h2>Page 1: Campaign Overview and Flow</h2>
            <h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
            <p>"World Where I Am Unwelcome" is a dark fantasy campaign set in the realm of Eyloria, a land torn between the forsaken god Ksavir and the oppressive Light of Torval and Elyria. The players, known as the Antiheroes, are guided by Ysmera, Last Daughter, to awaken Ksavir and overthrow the tyrannical rule of Mortimer II, who wields the reality-warping Mirror of Worlds in Avalon. The journey takes them from the desolate southwest (Misty Forest) to the gleaming northeast (Avalon), facing zealous followers, corrupted lands, and reality-bending threats.</p>

            <h3>Overarching GM Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tone:</strong> Maintain a dark, oppressive atmosphere. Use vivid descriptions of decay, zealotry, and warped reality to unsettle players.</li>
                <li><strong>Pacing:</strong> Balance combat, exploration, and roleplay. Each location should take 1-2 sessions, with Avalon as the climactic finale.</li>
                <li><strong>Player Agency:</strong> Let players choose how to approach challenges (e.g., diplomacy with NPCs, stealth, or combat), but ensure consequences for their actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> Drop hints about the Mirror of Worlds early (e.g., Ysmera’s prophecies, Thryme’s visions) to build anticipation for the final confrontation.</li>
            </ul>

                    <td>Use chaotic effects—sudden storms, gravity shifts. Zarath guards a Mirror shard, which PCs need. The environment should feel hostile and unpredictable.</td>

                    <td>Emphasize oppression—public executions, chanting crowds. Veyra performs a ritual in the city square; interrupting it angers her. Necrotic Guardians are everywhere.</td>

                    <td>Reality shifts (Investigation DC 20 to notice). The Mirror’s presence causes random magical effects (DMG Wild Magic table, 1/hour).</td>
                    <td>Use epic descriptions for the finale—towering spires, warped reality. Mortimer II resides in the central palace. Destroying the Mirror requires a ritual (Arcana DC 22).</td>

                    <td>Mortimer II is the final boss—use Time Stop to set up devastating combos (e.g., Disintegrate). He taunts PCs, mocking their quest. The Mirror must be destroyed (Arcana DC 22 ritual).</td>

            <h2>Page 5: Additional GM Tips</h2>
            <h3>Pacing the Campaign</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each location should take 1-2 sessions, depending on player choices. Allow time for exploration and roleplay, but keep combat encounters frequent to maintain tension.</li>
                <li>Use travel between locations to introduce minor encounters (e.g., a lone Grave Shadow, a wandering Chaos Beast) or environmental challenges (e.g., crossing a river, navigating a storm).</li>
                <li>Build toward the finale in Avalon—escalate the stakes with each location (e.g., the Mirror’s effects grow stronger as PCs approach).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creating Atmosphere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Misty Forest:</strong> Use sound effects—whispers, rustling leaves, distant wails. Describe the mist clinging to the PCs’ skin.</li>
                <li><strong>Swamps of Despair:</strong> Emphasize the oppressive air—drizzle, the stench of decay, the feeling of being watched.</li>
                <li><strong>Valley of Illusions:</strong> Describe surreal shifts—trees melting, the ground rippling. Use the PCs’ backstories to craft personal illusions.</li>
                <li><strong>Avalon:</strong> Contrast beauty with dread—gleaming spires, but the air crackles with warped energy. Reality bends (e.g., NPCs loop conversations).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Handling Player Choices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Allow PCs to negotiate with NPCs like Baba Yaga or Sister Lirien, but ensure consequences (e.g., Baba Yaga’s curses, Lirien’s tests of faith).</li>
                <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Reward creative stealth in places like Lightfort and Creststone City, but make failure costly (e.g., triggering alarms, summoning guards).</li>
                <li><strong>Combat:</strong> Encourage tactical play—e.g., disbelieving Illusionary Phantoms, using radiant damage against Grave Shadows. Punish recklessness with overwhelming odds (e.g., Zealot Constructs’ explosions).</li>
                <li><strong>Moral Dilemmas:</strong> Present tough choices—e.g., ally with Baba Yaga for power, or destroy the Mirror at the cost of destabilizing Eyloria.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scaling Difficulty</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For lower-level parties (Levels 5-7), reduce monster HP by 20% and lower save DCs by 2.</li>
                <li>For higher-level parties (Levels 10+), increase monster numbers (e.g., 3-5 Mist Wraiths instead of 2-4) and add 1-2 environmental hazards per encounter.</li>
                <li>Mortimer II can be scaled by adding legendary actions (e.g., cast a cantrip, teleport 30 ft) for a tougher finale.</li>
            </ul>
