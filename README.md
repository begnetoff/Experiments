 Experiments (HTML/CSS/JS)

A collection of small web experiments and learning projects (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
Focus areas: layout, DOM manipulation, simple interactions, and API basics.

 Projects
- Project list is evolving — each file/folder is a separate experiment.

 What I learned
- Basic frontend structure and styling
- Debugging and incremental improvements
- Working with simple scripts and external APIs (where applicable)
- Jeneral knowlege about API

 How to run
Open any `.html` file in a browser, Some of them work fine, some have visual bugs. I'll try to fix this when I'm not busy with other projects.
